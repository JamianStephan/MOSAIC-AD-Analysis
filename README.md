# MOSAIC-AD-Analysis
Old-Code is redundant code - old workspaces etc. used for testing. Not intended for use by others.
Main-Version has most up to date work. Should be able to be used by others.

NOTE: Any work regarding a Durham PSF will not be usable without downloading them from another source - they cannot be easily put on git due to their large file size.
