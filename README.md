# MOSAIC-AD-Analysis
Old-Code is redundant code - old workspaces etc. used for testing. Not intended for use by others.

Main-Version has most up to date work. Most should be able to be used by others (bar Durham PSF work), namely Snapshot-Graphs.ipynb and Integration-Graphs.ipynb

NOTE: Any work regarding a Durham PSF will not be usable without me sending them - they cannot be easily put on git due to their large file size.
