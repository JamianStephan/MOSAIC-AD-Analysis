# MOSAIC-AD-Analysis
Main-Version has most up to date work. Most should be able to be used by others (bar Durham PSF work), namely Snapshot Graphs.ipynb and Integration Graphs.ipynb

NOTE: Any work regarding a Durham PSF will not be usable without me sending them - they cannot be easily put on git due to their large file size.

For transmission results, Moffat PSFs are best case, and Durham PSFs are worst case. The true transmission losses will be somewhere inbetween
